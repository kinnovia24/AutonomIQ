    Here's a simple example of a Flash driver written in C. In this example, we are using a hypothetical Flash memory chip that communicates through SPI. The functions are placeholders and would need to be filled in with the correct commands for your specific Flash memory chip.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

// SPI functions
void SPI_Init(void);
void SPI_Write(uint8_t data);
uint8_t SPI_Read(void);

// Flash commands
#define FLASH_WRITE_ENABLE  0x06
#define FLASH_WRITE_DISABLE 0x04
#define FLASH_READ_STATUS   0x05
#define FLASH_WRITE         0x02
#define FLASH_READ          0x03
#define FLASH_ERASE         0x20

// Initializing the Flash driver
void Flash_Init(void) {
    SPI_Init();
}

// Enabling write operations
void Flash_Write_Enable(void) {
    SPI_Write(FLASH_WRITE_ENABLE);
}

// Disabling write operations
void Flash_Write_Disable(void) {
    SPI_Write(FLASH_WRITE_DISABLE);
}

// Reading the status register
uint8_t Flash_Read_Status(void) {
    SPI_Write(FLASH_READ_STATUS);
    return SPI_Read();
}

// Writing data to a specific address
void Flash_Write(uint32_t address, uint8_t data) {
    Flash_Write_Enable();
    SPI_Write(FLASH_WRITE);
    SPI_Write((address >> 16) & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write((address >> 8) & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write(address & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write(data);
    Flash_Write_Disable();
}

// Reading data from a specific address
uint8_t Flash_Read(uint32_t address) {
    SPI_Write(FLASH_READ);
    SPI_Write((address >> 16) & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write((address >> 8) & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write(address & 0xFF);
    return SPI_Read();
}

// Erasing a specific sector
void Flash_Erase(uint32_t address) {
    Flash_Write_Enable();
    SPI_Write(FLASH_ERASE);
    SPI_Write((address >> 16) & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write((address >> 8) & 0xFF);
    SPI_Write(address & 0xFF);
    Flash_Write_Disable();
}
```

Please note that this code is a basic template and does not handle any errors or perform any checks. It is highly recommended that you add error handling and checks as required by your specific application. Make sure to replace the SPI functions and Flash commands with the ones that are specific to your Flash memory chip and SPI module.

    Sure, I can provide a simple test for this Flash driver code. We'll create a few test cases to test the functionality of the flash memory operations such as initialization, writing, reading, and erasing. 

```c
#include <assert.h>

// Test SPI initialization
void test_SPI_Init(void) {
    SPI_Init();
    // You can add checks here to ensure the SPI is initialized correctly
    // This may involve checking some hardware-specific registers
    // assert(expression to check SPI initialization);
    printf("SPI_Init test passed.\n");
}

// Test Flash initialization
void test_Flash_Init(void) {
    Flash_Init();
    // Similar to SPI_Init, add checks here to ensure the Flash is initialized correctly
    // assert(expression to check Flash initialization);
    printf("Flash_Init test passed.\n");
}

// Test writing and reading a single byte of data
void test_Flash_Write_Read(void) {
    uint32_t test_address = 0x123456;
    uint8_t test_data = 0xAB;

    Flash_Write(test_address, test_data);
    uint8_t read_data = Flash_Read(test_address);

    assert(test_data == read_data);
    printf("Flash_Write_Read test passed.\n");
}

// Test erasing a sector
void test_Flash_Erase(void) {
    uint32_t test_address = 0x123456;
    
    Flash_Erase(test_address);
    // After erasing, all bytes in the sector should be 0xFF
    // For simplicity, we'll just check the first byte
    assert(Flash_Read(test_address) == 0xFF);
    printf("Flash_Erase test passed.\n");
}

int main(void) {
    test_SPI_Init();
    test_Flash_Init();
    test_Flash_Write_Read();
    test_Flash_Erase();

    printf("All tests passed.\n");
    return 0;
}
```

This is a basic test suite which only covers the main functionality. In a real world application, you would also want to add more comprehensive tests including edge cases, error conditions, and performance tests.

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        import sys
        params = [12]
        result = test_function(*params)  # Assuming the test function is named 'test_function'
        print(result)
